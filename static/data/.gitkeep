# Static Data Directory

This directory contains static JSON files for viewer mode deployment.

Files:
- `people.json` - Person records exported from the database
- `relationships.json` - Relationship records exported from the database

To generate these files, run:
```bash
npm run export-data
```

This directory is used when the application is built with `VITE_VIEWER_MODE=true`.
